The input of the system is users' click matrix which depicts the interaction.

    "News recommendation can help users find interested news and alleviate information over- load. Precisely modeling news and users is critical for news recommendation, and capturing the contexts of words and news is important to learn news and user representations. The paper, proposea a neural news recommendation approach with multi-head self-attention (NRMS). The core of the approach is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder, it is used multi-head self-attentions to learn news representations from news titles by modeling the interactions between words. In the user encoder, it is learned the representations of users from their browsed news and use multihead self-attention to capture the relatedness between the news. Besides, it is appled additive attention to learn more informative news and user representations by selecting important words and news.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This approch is motivated by several observations. First, the interactions between words in news title are important for understanding the news. For example, the word “Rockets” has strong relatedness with “Bulls”. Besides, a word may in- teract with multiple words, e.g., “Rockets” also has semantic interactions with “trade”. Second, different news articles browsed by the same user may also have relatedness. For example, in Fig. 1 the second news is related to the first and the third news. Third, different words may have different importance in representing news. In Fig. 1, the word “NBA” is more informative than “2018”. Besides, different news articles browsed by the same user may also have different importance in representing this user. For example, the first three news articles are more informative than the last one."

    "In the paper, they propose a neural news recommendation approach with multi-head self- attention (NRMS). The core of our approach is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder, we learn news representations from news titles by using multi-head self-attention to model the interactions between words. In the user encoder, They learn representations of users from their browsing by using multi-head self-attention to capture their relatedness. Besides, we apply additive attentions to both news and user encoders to select important words and news to learn more informative news and user representations. Extensive experiments on a realworld dataset show that our approach can effectively and efficiently improve the performance of news recommendation."

    "We manage to enhance the model with more given features which we explored before, i.e. news abstract text feature, user personality feature. Features should be properly integrated, so we plug in a deep & cross structure after the News encoder. Concretely, title embeddings, abstract embeddings are concatenated as a whole feature and passed in two seperated feature extraction models: deep network and cross network. Deep network tends to select high-dimensional latent features while cross network works as feature combination.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In order to merge user-related features such as user's category perference into the model, another attention-based idea is implemented. We find out that the data given in the MIND is pretty biased. The category \"news\" and \"sports\" dominates the total distribution, while some categories only appear a few times. If we employ the frequency-based method to calculate the weight for each title and abstract embedding features, it is very likely that we totally omit those unpopular news. It will certainly degrade the performance if a given user coincidentally loves those news!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As a result, we implements a trick based on the idea from tf-idf algorithm. Similar to the gist in tf-idf, the weight of corresponding new's title and abstract is positively related to the frequency it appears in the user's history impression and negatively related to the global frequency it appears in the whole dataset. After some experiments, we also find that simply multiply the weights with the feature is not a good idea. Instead, an addition attention (adding the original features with the attentive features) improves the performance of the model."

    "During training time we get an outperformed performance with respect to the original NRMS. Our AUC statistic is 0.72, and NDCG-10 is over 0.4, which is a pretty good result. But a fun way to see the model working is by trying to imagine ourselves the type of user based on the news previously seen by the user and create possible hypotheses, such as the user seems to be interested in Hollywood news and sports but not in Political news. Therefore, from a pool of candidate news based on our intuitions as humans, we will expect that political news will be rank lower than sports news for example.|"
